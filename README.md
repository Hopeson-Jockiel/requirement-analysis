Repository for exploring and documenting requirement analysis in software development.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, documenting, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It serves as the foundation of the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**, ensuring that the final product aligns with user requirements and business goals.

During this phase, developers, analysts, and stakeholders work together to:
- Understand what the users need from the system.
- Define functional and non-functional requirements.
- Detect ambiguities, conflicts, or inconsistencies in the requirements.
- Prioritize requirements based on importance and feasibility.

### Importance of Requirement Analysis
Requirement Analysis is crucial because it:
1. **Prevents Miscommunication:** Clearly defines what is to be built, reducing misunderstandings between clients and developers.  
2. **Saves Time and Cost:** Identifying issues early avoids costly changes in later stages of development.  
3. **Improves Quality:** Ensures that the system meets user expectations and performs as intended.  
4. **Provides a Clear Roadmap:** Acts as a reference for design, development, and testing teams throughout the SDLC.  

In summary, Requirement Analysis transforms vague ideas into clear, actionable requirements â€” forming the blueprint for successful software projects.
